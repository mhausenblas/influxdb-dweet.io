# InfluxDB - dweet.io data ingest

This is an experiment to ingest data from [dweet.io](http://dweet.io) into 
[InfluxDB](http://influxdb.com/download/).

## Dependencies

I assume that you've InfluxDB installed and also its
[Python client lib](http://influxdb.com/docs/v0.8/client_libraries/python.html).
Further, a database in InfluxDB with the name `dweet` must exist along with
the following user (with Admin role enabled):

    user name: dweet
    password:  dweet

## Usage


TBD.
